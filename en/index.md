## 2024 Summer School on Combinatorics and Algorithms

[Korean](/)

- Date: 22-26 July 2024.
- Place: Bldg. N1, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea.
  
The 2024 Summer School on Combinatorics and Algorithms is a venue for students and early-career researchers to learn selected topics in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. 
It will be a great opportunity for young and aspiring researchers to study topics which are important but not covered during the lecture in the university classes.
This summer, two lecture series, combinatorial optimization and grid minot theorem, will be given by two leading experts on the subjects. There will be exercise sessions where you form a team and solve challenging questions related to the lecture subjects.
