2024 Summer School on Combinatorics and Algorithms
====================

The 2024 Summer School on Combinatorics and Algorithms is a venue for students and early-career researchers to learn selected topics in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. 
It will be a great opportunity for young and aspiring researchers to study topics which are important but not covered during the lecture in the university classes.
This summer, two lecture series, combinatorial optimization and grid minot theorem, will be given by two leading experts on the subjects. There will be exercise sessions where you form a team and solve challenging questions related to the lecture subjects.

연사 및 프로그램 소개 Lecturers and Topics
---------------------
- [Chien-Chung Huang (ENS Paris, France)](https://www.di.ens.fr/~cchuang/): Combinatorial Optimization

This lecture (12.5h) will cover essential topics in combinatorial optimization including: Berge's theorem, Konig's theorem, Egervary's theorem, Karger's min-cut algorithm and Gomory-Hu trees, Edmonds' blossom algorithm for maximum matching, matroid 101, multi-commodity flow and k-coverage problems.

- [Sebastian Wiederrecht (DIMAG-IBS, Korea)](https://www.wiederrecht.com/): From treewidth to grid minor theorem

This lecture (6h) will present the notion of tree decomposition, treewidth and graph minor, and introduce the grid minor theorem by Robertson and Seymour. Grid minor theory is deemed as one of the most important theory in modern graph theory and has many applications in algorithms design, data structure, logic, etc.
