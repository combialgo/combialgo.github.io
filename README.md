연사 및 프로그램 소개
---------------------
- [Chien-Chung Huang (ENS Paris, France)](https://www.di.ens.fr/~cchuang/): Combinatorial Optimization
This lecture (12.5h) will cover essential topics in combinatorial optimization including: Berge's theorem, Konig's theorem, Egervary's theorem, Karger's min-cut algorithm and Gomory-Hu trees, Edmonds' blossom algorithm for maximum matching, matroid 101, multi-commodity flow and k-coverage problems.

- [Sebastian Wiederrecht (DIMAG-IBS, Korea)](https://www.wiederrecht.com/): From treewidth to grid minor theorem
This lecture (6h) will present the notion of tree decomposition, treewidth and graph minor, and introduce the grid minor theorem by Robertson and Seymour. Grid minor theory is deemed as one of the most important theory in modern graph theory and has many applications in algorithms design, data structure, logic, etc.
