- [Sebastian Wiederrecht (DIMAG-IBS, Korea)](https://www.wiederrecht.com/): From treewidth to grid minor theorem 

This lecture (6h) will present the notion of tree decomposition, treewidth and graph minor, and introduce the grid minor theorem by Robertson and Seymour. Grid minor theory is deemed as one of the most important theory in modern graph theory and has many applications in algorithms design, data structure, logic, etc.
