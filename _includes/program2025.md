#### Induced Subgraphs and Induced Minors of Graphs

In graph theory, the notion of minor extends that of subgraph by further allowing edge contractions.
There is a deep and beautiful theory of graph minors, initiated and mainly carried out by Robertson and Seymour in the Graph Minors Project.
Among the remarkable results, we find the following theorems.

1. There exists a function f such that every graph of treewidth at least f(k) contains a k &times; k grid as a minor, or a subdivision of a k &times; k wall as a subgraph.

2. Every class excluding a planar graph as a minor has bounded treewidth.

3. Graphs excluding a fixed minor H can be ‚Äúdecomposed‚Äù into graphs that are ‚Äúalmost embeddable‚Äù on surfaces of bounded genus (Robertson and Seymour‚Äôs structure theorem).

4. The relation ‚Äúbeing a minor of‚Äù is a well-quasi-order on the class of all finite graphs.

5. For every class ùíû excluding a fixed minor, the n-vertex graphs in ùíû have treewidth O(‚àön).

These facts have interesting algorithmic onsequences. In classes excluding a fixed graph as a minor, most problems can be solved faster or approximated better than on general graphs. However, even the simplest dense class, the class of all complete graphs, does not exclude any graph as a minor. This is because edge deletions are allowed in the definition of minor. What if we disallow them? We then get the notion of induced minor.

This class revisits all the above facts for *induced* minors. This is a developing theory, about five years old, with a few positive results and must-know constructions, and several exciting conjectures.

#### Structural Theory of Sparse Graphs

What does it mean for a graph to be sparse? The answer to this innocently looking question turns out to be not so obvious: depending on the point of view, different concepts of sparsity can be studied. We will take a deeper dive into a particular angle on this topic, introduced around 2008 by Ne≈°et≈ôil and Ossona de Mendez. They proposed to measure the density of local structures that can be found in graphs: the so-called shallow minors. This point of view leads to two natural definitions --- of graph classes of bounded expansion and of nowhere dense graph classes --- that capture the idea of uniform sparsity visible at a local level. It turns out that both notions admit multiple different combinatorial characterizations, each presenting a different facet of the concept and providing a technique for working with sparse graphs. The emerging net of relationships became a research area called Sparsity. Apart from a myriad of graph-theoretic tools, the area also offers a number of algorithmic applications and has intricate connections with finite model theory.

During the lectures and tutorials, we will give a broad introduction to Sparsity. Below is a tentative range of topics that will be covered:
- Measuring sparsity: Shallow (topological) minors and measuring sparsity using them. Concepts of bounded expansion and nowhere denseness.
- Structural characterizations: Generalized coloring numbers, treedepth and low treedepth coverings and their relation with bounded expansion and nowhere denseness. Combinatorial and algorithmic applications.
- Characterizations of nowhere denseness: flatness (aka uniform quasi-wideness) and Splitter game.
- Outlook on the model-theoretic structure theory for dense graphs: transductions, monadic stability, monadic dependence, flip-flatness and Flipper games.
